### Project CODE-CHALLENGE

#### Decisions Taken:
I chose to use StyleSheet for styling due to its convenience and ease of use, implementing a global stylesheet for this purpose. Additionally, I integrated `react-navigation/native` for the bottom navigation bar inside the app. I used a JSON file to store and access each post, along with `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` to manage posts saved by users.

#### How to Run the Application:

1. Download or clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/francogarcia02/Code-Challenge.git`
2. Use the command `cd Code-Challenge` and `npm install` to download the required packages listed in package.json .
3. Use the command `npm start` to start the application.
4. Utilize the Expo app on a mobile device to scan the QR code or use a mobile device emulator.

#### Code Documentation:
I provided screenshots from android while the application was running,
save them in the assets/Screenshots folder
