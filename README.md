### Project CODE-CHALLENGE

#### Decisions Taken:
I chose to use StyleSheet for styling because it is convenient and easy to use. I utilized a global stylesheet with this tool.

#### How to Run the Application:
1. Download the required packages listed in package.json.
2. Use the command `npm start` to start the application.
3. Utilize the Expo app on a mobile device to scan the QR code or use a mobile device emulator.

#### Code Documentation:
I implemented `react-navigation/native` for the bottom bar navigation in the application.
